# Memory Game Project

## What is it?
Memory game is a project from Udacity Front-End Nanodegree.
My job was to convert this project from a static project to an interactive one. This will require modifying the HTML and CSS files, but primarily the JavaScript file (game's logic).

## How to Play
All you need to do is run the file **index.html.**

## How the Game Works
The game consists in 8 pairs of cards sorted ramdomly. You have 5 seconds to memoryze the positions of each card an then try to make the matches. Each attempty is registered in a move counter and a timer is also displayed at screen.

Your job is to make the 8 matches in the shortest possible time and with the smallest possible number of moves.

## Requirements
This game only works in modern web browsers.
